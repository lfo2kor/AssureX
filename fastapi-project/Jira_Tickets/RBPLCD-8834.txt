Problem Description:
If a test already exists in the project, it should be visible during the copy process currently, it's not. Additionally, after switching the project, the test retains previous values that don't actually exist in the selected project
Steps to Reproduce:
1.	Login
2.	Navigate to Projects
3.	create a new task under default_StructureLevel_1
4.	 go to Tasks and open default_test_meas
5.	 Create a run inside it, and try copying that run into the newly created task under default_StructureLevel_1.
